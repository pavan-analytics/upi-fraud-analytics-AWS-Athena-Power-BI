Q2) Which payment channels (UPI Transfer / Wallet Pay / QR Scan etc) are statistically more vulnerable to fraudulent activity?
SELECT 
    payment_type,
    SUM(fraud_label) AS fraud_count,
    COUNT(*) AS total_count,
    ROUND((SUM(fraud_label)*100.0/COUNT(*)),2) AS fraud_rate_pct
FROM raw_data
GROUP BY payment_type
ORDER BY fraud_rate_pct DESC;
